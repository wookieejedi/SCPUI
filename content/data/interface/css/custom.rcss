THIS FILE IS MEANT TO BE EMPTY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DEFAULT FONT SELECTION

Custom.rcss is intended to be replaced by your mod's local version of Custom.rcss.
Every RML file calls this RCSS file so you can put any customized css classes in the file
to be loaded wherever needed.

Use Custom.rcss to also redefine your default font preference.
